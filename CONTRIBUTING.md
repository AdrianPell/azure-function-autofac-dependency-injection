First off, thanks for being interested in contributing!

There are no formal requirements for contributing beyond ensuring the project works after your changes are made. Within the project there are two sample projects for .NET Framework and .NET Core that you need to run and test the endpoint.

After you have validated that the project builds and runs please ensure you have incremeneted the version number and feel free to submit a pull request to be reviewed.

I have two small children so it can sometimes take me a but to respond to all the github communications but I will review it ASAP.

Thanks and happy coding!
